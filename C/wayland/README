 * Debian/Ubuntu:
   *************
   $ sudo apt install libwayland-dev libegl-dev libgles-dev libvulkan-dev

 * Fedora/RHEL:
   ***********
   $ sudo dnf install wayland-devel libglvnd-devel vulkan-loader-devel


BUILDING

  $ make
   or
  $ DEBUG=1 make

  $ make clean


LIST
----

 * wayland-01-list_interfaces:
 Lists the current Wayland compositor's supported interfaces.

 * wayland-03-shm_software_rendering:
 Displays a white square in Software mode.

 * wayland-04-shm_software_rendering-redraw :
 Displays a white square in Software mode, that slowly overwrites
itself with colored artefacts (using Wayland's internal 'callback'
mechanism for quickest-possible redraw in Software mode).

 * wayland-05-accelerated_rendering-opengl :
 Displays a white square in EGL/OpenGL mode, that quickly blinks
from White to Black -and forth. OpenGL ES is used is possible,
otherwise desktop OpenGL.

 * wayland-06-accelerated_rendering-vulkan :
 Displays a white square in Vulkan mode, that quickly blinks from
Black to White -and forth.

 * wayland-07-input :
 Displays a white square in Software mode, showing logs about
mouse position & button-clicks in the terminal.
 
 * wayland-08-input_shell :
 Displays a window with a hand-drawn titlebar in Software mode,
showing logs about mouse position & button-clicks in the terminal,
AND having basic window management (aka "shell") capabilities:
move, maximize, un-maximize, minimize.
 
 * wayland-08bis-input_shell-libdecor [OPTIONAL] :
 (Same as above, but) uses the popular "libdecor" library to
wrap and remove complicated shell code.
 [ INSTALL AND BUILD WITH:
  $ sudo apt install libdecor-0-dev
  $ DECOR=1 make ]

 * wayland-09-drag_and_drop :
 (Same as above, but) with a gray square that follows the mouse,
and the abilitiy to "drag & drop" it from the window to another
-such as 'weston-terminal'- to display a dynamic message.
