Simple (but accurate) sample Wayland clients.

Verified compatible since Wayland/Weston 1.5.0 (2014/05/20).
Able to build with and/or use newer features: Vulkan rendering,
xdg_toplevel_set_minimized()...


PREREQUISITES
-------------

 * Debian/Ubuntu:
   *************
   $ sudo apt install libwayland-dev libegl-dev libgles-dev libvulkan-dev

 * Fedora/RHEL:
   ***********
   $ sudo dnf install wayland-devel libglvnd-devel vulkan-loader-devel


BUILDING
--------
  $ make
   or to disable Vulkan samples:
  $ VULKAN=0 make
   or to build the libdecor sample:
  $ DECOR=1 make
   or to be a real gU4u:
  $ DEBUG=1 make

  $ make clean


LIST
----

 * wayland-01-list_interfaces:
 Lists the current Wayland compositor's supported interfaces.

 * wayland-02-list_interfaces-opengl_vulkan:
 Lists the current Wayland compositor's supported interfaces and
versions EGL/OpenGL(ES) & Vulkan.

 * wayland-03-shm_software_rendering:
 Displays a white square in Software mode.

 * wayland-04-shm_software_rendering-redraw :
 Displays a white square in Software mode, that slowly overwrites
itself with colored artefacts (using Wayland's internal 'callback'
mechanism for quickest-possible redraw without tearing).

 * wayland-05-accelerated_rendering-opengl :
 Displays a white square in EGL/OpenGL mode, that quickly blinks
from White to Black and forth (OpenGL ES is used if possible;
otherwise desktop OpenGL).

 * wayland-06-accelerated_rendering-vulkan :
 Displays a white square in Vulkan mode, that quickly blinks from
Black to White and forth.

 * wayland-07-input :
 Displays a white square in Software mode, showing mouse position
& click logs in the terminal.
 
 * wayland-08-input_shell :
 Displays a window with a custom-drawn titlebar in Software mode,
with basic window management (aka "shell") capabilities: move,
maximize, un-maximize, minimize. It also shows mouse position &
click logs in the terminal.
 
 * wayland-08bis-input_shell-libdecor [OPTIONAL] :
 (Same as above, but) uses the popular "libdecor" library to draw
a titlebar and handle most of the shell code.
 [ INSTALL PREREQUISITE AND BUILD WITH:
  $ sudo apt install libdecor-0-dev
  $ DECOR=1 make ]

 * wayland-09-drag_and_drop :
 (Same as above, but) with a gray square that follows the mouse,
and the abilitiy to "drag & drop" it from the window to another
-such as 'weston-terminal'- to display a dynamic message.
